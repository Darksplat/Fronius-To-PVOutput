# Fronius-To-PVOutput
Fronius To PVOutput php script

/**********************************************************************************
PHP Script to extract data from a Fronius Inverter and Meter and push it to PVOutput account.
The script is designed to be run every five (5) minutes from a host computer which
can access the inverter and access the PVOutput website. I use my Synology NAS.
The script was tested against a Fronius Symo GEN24 10.0 3 phase system With a
Smart Meter 63A 3 phase system
Use it at your peril. All useful feed-back will be appreciated.
